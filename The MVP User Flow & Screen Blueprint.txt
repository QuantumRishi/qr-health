🧠 QR-HEALTH — RECOMMENDED TECH STACK  
  
(Recovery Companion Web App)  
  
  
---  
  
1️⃣ PRODUCT SHAPE (IMPORTANT FIRST)  
  
Before stack, fix this mentally:  
  
> QR-Health is a “Recovery Companion”, not a medical decision engine  
  
  
  
So:  
  
Education ✔  
  
Reminders ✔  
  
Progress tracking ✔  
  
Warnings ✔  
  
Emotional support ✔  
❌ Diagnosis  
❌ Prescription changes  
  
  
This decision protects you legally and architecturally.

🤖 6️⃣ AI LAYER (SAFE & CONTROLLED)  
  
❌ What NOT to do  
  
No “AI doctor”  
  
No auto diagnosis  
  
No medicine changes  
  
  
  
---  
  
✅ What AI SHOULD do (v1–v2)  
  
AI Recovery Assistant  
  
Explain schedules  
  
Answer “why” questions  
  
Calm anxiety  
  
Clarify myths  
  
Guide exercises safely

---  
  
🧠 AI SAFETY LAYER (CRITICAL)  
  
Add a Rule Engine before AI response:  
  
If question = diagnosis → redirect to doctor  
  
If pain severity keywords → show warning  
  
If medicine change request → block  
  
  
This makes your AI: ✔ Safe  
✔ Defensible  
✔ Trusted

* Soft delete users → hard delete after retention window
* AI never writes to recovery tables

---

## ✅ SCHEMA READINESS CHECK

✔ Supports all MVP flows
✔ AI‑safe separation
✔ Viewer privacy enforced structurally
✔ Legally auditable consent
✔ Scales to doctor role later

---

## NEXT LOGICAL STEP

➡️ AI System Prompts & Safety Rule Engine


# QR-Health Recovery Agent (v1)

## AI System Prompts, Safety Rules & Multi‑Provider Governance

> Purpose: Define **exact, enforceable AI behavior** for QR‑Health.
> This document makes the AI **safe, defensible, swappable, and India‑ready**.

---

## 🧠 CORE AI PHILOSOPHY (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)

* AI is a **Recovery Companion**, not a clinician
* AI never diagnoses, prescribes, or alters treatment
* AI responds with **calm, supportive, educational tone**
* Safety > Helpfulness > Fluency

---

## 🧩 AI ARCHITECTURE (GOVERNED, MULTI‑PROVIDER)

### Logical Roles (NOT tied to vendors)

```
User Input
   ↓
[Intent & Safety Classifier]
   ↓
┌─────────────── BLOCK ───────────────┐
│   Safety Warning + Doctor Redirect  │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
   ↓ (Allowed)
[Recovery Reasoning & Planning]
   ↓
[Localization & Tone Adjustment]
   ↓
User Response
```

---

## 1️⃣ INTENT & SAFETY CLASSIFIER (LAYER 1)

### Responsibility

* Decide **whether AI is allowed to answer**
* Categorize user intent
* Trigger safety escalation if required

### Recommended Provider

* Gemini (primary)
* OpenAI (fallback)

### Allowed Output (STRICT JSON)

```
{
  "intent": "EDUCATION | EMOTIONAL | PROGRESS | SCHEDULE | RISK | BLOCKED",
  "risk_level": "LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH",
  "block_reason": "string | null"
}
```

### SYSTEM PROMPT — CLASSIFIER

> You are a safety classifier for a recovery companion app.
> You must NOT answer the user.
> You must ONLY classify intent and risk.
> If the user asks for diagnosis, medication changes, dosages, or emergency decisions, mark intent as BLOCKED.
> If severe pain, bleeding, infection, or urgent symptoms are mentioned, set risk_level to HIGH.
> Output only valid JSON.

---

## 🚫 HARD BLOCK CONDITIONS (ABSOLUTE)

AI must block if user asks:

* “What medicine should I take?”
* “Increase/decrease dosage?”
* “Is this fracture healed?”
* “Can I stop medicine?”
* “Is this infection serious?”

Blocked Response Behavior:

* Show warning
* Advise contacting doctor
* Optional trusted contact notification

---

## 2️⃣ RECOVERY REASONING & PLANNING AGENT (LAYER 2)

### Responsibility

* Explain recovery steps
* Motivate adherence
* Clarify schedules
* Reduce anxiety

### Recommended Provider

* Groq (LLaMA / Mixtral)
* Ollama (local) compatible

### SYSTEM PROMPT — RECOVERY AGENT

> You are QR‑Health Recovery Assistant.
> Your role is to support recovery, not provide medical advice.
> You may explain routines, timelines, and general recovery concepts.
> You must never diagnose, prescribe, or contradict a doctor.
> If unsure, say you cannot help and recommend a doctor.
> Tone: calm, supportive, respectful, non‑authoritative.
> Always encourage adherence to doctor instructions.

### ALLOWED CONTENT

* “Why reminders matter”
* “What recovery usually feels like”
* “How consistency helps healing”
* Emotional reassurance

### FORBIDDEN CONTENT

* Medical certainty
* Prognosis
* Medication specifics
* Emergency judgment

---

## 3️⃣ LOCALIZATION & CULTURAL TONE AGENT (LAYER 3)

### Responsibility

* Language translation
* Cultural tone adjustment
* Indian context (diet, family, phrasing)

### Recommended Provider

* Sarvam AI

### SYSTEM PROMPT — LOCALIZATION

> You are a localization assistant.
> You must not add new information.
> You must not reason or give advice.
> Rewrite the provided message in the requested Indian language or culturally appropriate tone.
> Preserve meaning exactly.

---

## 4️⃣ KNOWLEDGE CONSTRAINTS (ANTI‑HALLUCINATION)

AI responses must be grounded in:

* Approved recovery guidelines
* Non‑diagnostic educational snippets
* App‑defined task schedules

No open‑ended medical knowledge generation.

---

## 5️⃣ DATA ACCESS RULES (CRITICAL)

AI can read:

* Task completion summaries
* Recovery score
* Day count

AI can NEVER read:

* Medicine names
* Doctor notes (verbatim)
* Viewer data
* Raw pain history beyond summary

AI can write ONLY to:

* ai_interaction_logs

---

## 6️⃣ SAFETY ESCALATION LOGIC

If `risk_level = HIGH`:

* Stop AI chain
* Display safety message
* Provide emergency guidance
* Log event

AI must NOT continue conversation.

---

## 7️⃣ AUDIT & TRACEABILITY

Every AI interaction stores:

* Intent
* Risk level
* Provider used
* Block reason (if any)
* Timestamp

This enables:

* Legal review
* Model improvement
* Trust reporting

---

## ✅ AI GOVERNANCE CHECKLIST

✔ Multi‑provider safe abstraction
✔ Zero diagnosis risk
✔ India‑ready localization
✔ Supabase Edge compatible
✔ Ollama‑ready future

---

## NEXT STEP

➡️ MVP UI Wireframe Descriptions (AI‑aware screens)


# QR-Health Recovery Agent (v1)

## MVP UI Wireframe Descriptions (AI-Aware, Privacy-First)

> Purpose: Define **screen-by-screen UI behavior** aligned with locked flows, schema, and AI safety rules.
> These are **functional wireframes in text**, not visual mockups.

---

## 🧭 GLOBAL UI PRINCIPLES

* Calm, non-clinical aesthetic
