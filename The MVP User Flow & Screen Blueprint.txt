This is where Quantum Rishi thinking + real-world healthcare constraints meet.  
I’ll give you a clear, future-proof tech stack that is:  
  
✔ Web-first  
✔ AI-agent ready  
✔ Privacy-safe (India-compliant mindset)  
✔ Supports recovery notifications to friends & family  
✔ Scales from solo MVP → enterprise QR-Health  
  
No fluff, no hype.

🧠 QR-HEALTH — RECOMMENDED TECH STACK  
  
(Recovery Companion Web App)  
  
  
---  
  
1️⃣ PRODUCT SHAPE (IMPORTANT FIRST)  
  
Before stack, fix this mentally:  
  
> QR-Health is a “Recovery Companion”, not a medical decision engine  
  
  
  
So:  
  
Education ✔  
  
Reminders ✔  
  
Progress tracking ✔  
  
Warnings ✔  
  
Emotional support ✔  
❌ Diagnosis  
❌ Prescription changes  
  
  
This decision protects you legally and architecturally.  
  
---  
##Mandatory:
Recuirments as per qr-ui-kit:  Radix + Tailwind + ShadCN-Svelte + Supabase (cloud for Temporary)
  
---  
  
🌐 2️⃣ FRONTEND (WEB APP)  
  
✅ Recommended  
  
Next.js (React)  
  
SSR + SEO (important for trust)  
  
Fast  
  
Works great with auth & APIs

Why this fits QR  
  
You already think in systems  
  
Component-based = reusable for future QR products  
  
Easy PWA conversion later  
  
  
  
---  
  
🧱 3️⃣ BACKEND (CORE LOGIC)  
  
✅ Recommended  
  
Node.js + NestJS (or FastAPI if you prefer Python-heavy AI)  
  
Why NestJS:  
  
Strong structure (controllers, services, guards)  
  
Enterprise-ready  
  
Easy role-based access (patient / family / admin)  
  
Clean audit logging (important for health apps)  
  
  
  
---  
  
🗄️ 4️⃣ DATABASE (HEALTH DATA SAFE)  
  
Primary DB  
  
PostgreSQL  
  
Structured health data  
  
ACID compliance  
  
Strong relations (users ↔ meds ↔ schedules)  
  
  
Cache / Session  
  
Redis  
  
Reminder queues  
  
Notification jobs  
  
Temporary auth tokens  
  
  
  
---  
  
🔐 5️⃣ AUTH + PRIVACY (VERY IMPORTANT)  
  
Authentication  
  
Email + OTP (initially)  
  
Optional WhatsApp OTP later  
  
No social login in v1 (privacy-first)  
  
  
Authorization  
  
Roles:  
  
Patient (owner)  
  
Family Viewer (read-only)  
  
Doctor (future)  
  
Admin (QR internal)  
  
  
  
---  
  
🛡️ Privacy Rules (Non-Negotiable)  
  
✔ Data encrypted at rest  
✔ HTTPS only  
✔ Role-based access  
✔ No public health URLs  
✔ Explicit consent for family sharing  
  
India compliance mindset:  
  
Follow DPDP Act principles  
  
Clear consent checkbox  
  
“Delete my data” button  
  
  
  
---  
  
🤖 6️⃣ AI LAYER (SAFE & CONTROLLED)  
  
❌ What NOT to do  
  
No “AI doctor”  
  
No auto diagnosis  
  
No medicine changes  
  
  
  
---  
  
✅ What AI SHOULD do (v1–v2)  
  
AI Recovery Assistant  
  
Explain schedules  
  
Answer “why” questions  
  
Calm anxiety  
  
Clarify myths  
  
Guide exercises safely  
  
  
  
---  
  
AI Stack Options  
  
Option A (Local-first / Privacy-heavy)  
  
Ollama (LLaMA / Mistral)  
  
Hosted on your server  
  
Zero patient data leaves infra  
  
  
Best for:  
  
QR ethos  
  
Trust  
  
Long-term enterprise  
  
  
Option B (Hybrid)

Strict prompt filters  
  
No data retention  
  
  
Use for:  
  
Early MVP speed  
  
  
➡️ You can design AI Provider Interface so you can swap later.  
  
  
---  
  
🧠 AI SAFETY LAYER (CRITICAL)  
  
Add a Rule Engine before AI response:  
  
If question = diagnosis → redirect to doctor  
  
If pain severity keywords → show warning  
  
If medicine change request → block  
  
  
This makes your AI: ✔ Safe  
✔ Defensible  
✔ Trusted

This keeps:  
  
Legal risk low  
  
Trust high  
  
Expansion easy
